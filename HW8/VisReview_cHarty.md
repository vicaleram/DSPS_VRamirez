Review by Catherine Harty

CLARITY: The plot is easy to read. Each data point is clearly marked, and there are no data points being covered up. 
The labels in the legend are somewhat confusing however. The 'Upper','Lower', and 'median' labels are vague and are not explained in the description.

AESTHETIC: The colors work great with Deuteranopia and Protanopia, but are difficult to distinguish with Tritanopia and Grayscale.
Nothing on the graph is distorted or distracting. Connecting each data set really helped with the readability. 

HONESTY: The data does not appear to be dishonest. The scales for the x and y axis do not distort the graph.

Suggestions:
1) Consider putting more of an explanation into what was going on in the graph. The labels were vague and it might have 
also been worthwhile to explain what caused the spike in the mortality rate around 1999.

2) Since the colors are hard to distinguish in grayscale and for individuals with Tritanopia, consider making the markers different shapes.

3) Consider increasing the font size for the title and labels on the graph. 

Quality: Overall, the graph does a great job at representing very important data. It does not mislead or distact in any way.
