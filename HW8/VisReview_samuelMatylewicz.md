Review of Victor's homework 8 visualization:

Improvement Recommendations:

  1. The three lines for upper, median, and lower are confusing. I do not understand why there is 3 sets of data for the
     mortaility rate measurment. I recommend either explaining the purpose of including all three lines in the caption, or
     only including the median dataset. The inclusion of all three lines gets more confusing as you follow them to 2019 and
     they all change very differently. By following the lower line, one could think that the mortality rate is improving
     significantly, but following the upper line, mortality rate grows very fast. This makes it hard to understand exactly
     what information you are trying to show me. As it stands currently I would consider this "fluff".
     
  2. I think it would be a good addition to add more precise axis ticks for the x-axis. Counting by threes leaves ambiguity
     at a few different important x quantities. 
     - It is hard to tell which year the initial spike occured.
     - It is hard to tell which year is the begining of Maduro's regime.
     - It is hard to tell which year mortality rate begins to jurastically rise.
     - It is hard to tell which year the x-axis ends.
     
  3. It would be helpful information to include an explaination of the ~2000 mortality rate spike in the caption. 
     This is a distracting feature of the visualization, and the lack of explaination leaves me feeling like I did not 
     gather all of the important information from the dataset.
     
Good Quality:

  1. I really liked the vertical line you included to show the start of Maduro's regime. It would have been very easy to
     just write the start date in the caption, but the extra effort to include this line makes it very clear to the
     viewer that the feature you are trying to show occurs ~2013.
