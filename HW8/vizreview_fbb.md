This is a very compelling and powerful graph! the data is really dramatic, and extremely convincing! 

The choice of displaying both points and line is however distracting and the upper-lower-and median would be better conveyed with a fill-between. This would allow you a graphical element for the epoch mark of when Maduro came to power, as w black solid line, which would be more powerful than the dashed red line.
